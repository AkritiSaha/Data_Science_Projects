# Data Science Projects

This repository contains three different data science projects related to machine learning predictions. The projects include Titanic survival prediction, student performance prediction, and house price prediction.

## Projects

### Titanic Prediction
- **Description**: This project uses a machine learning model to predict whether passengers survived on the Titanic based on various features.
- **Files**:
  - "D:\Data Science Projects\Titanic Prediction Project.ipynb": Code for the Titanic prediction model.
  - "D:\Data Science Projects\train.csv": Titanic dataset used for training the model.
  

### Student Performance Prediction
- **Description**: This project predicts student performance based on factors like study time, parental education, etc.
- **Files**:
  - "D:\Data Science Projects\Student Performance Prediction Project.ipynb": Code for predicting student scores.
  - "D:\Data Science Projects\StudentsPerformance.csv": Dataset containing student information.
  

### House Price Prediction
- **Description**: This project predicts house prices based on various factors such as area, number of rooms, and location.
- **Files**:
  - "D:\Data Science Projects\Houseprice prediction Project.ipynb": Code for house price prediction model.
  - "D:\Data Science Projects\train.csv": Dataset containing information about houses.
  .

## Datasets
